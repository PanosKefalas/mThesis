# Analysis and modelling of air quality monitoring node data with computational intelligence methods

## Abstract

Air pollution is considered the single most important environmental health risk factor in
Europe, causing respiratory and cardiovascular disease, leading even to premature deaths. In
this thesis analysis is being performed and results outlined concerning the current profile of
air quality for the city of Thessaloniki, according to data measured by Air Quality and Weather
Monitoring Nodes located on the roof of the building E14, Faculty of Engineering, of Aristotle
University of Thessaloniki. The nodes are being compared in order to investigate correlation
between measurements. Concentration levels of Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) are being
investigated. Machine learning and statistical models are being utilized to fill missing data and
forecast air pollutants future values. Their integrity is being validated. Results were accurate
concerning most pollutants after proper model calibration.
